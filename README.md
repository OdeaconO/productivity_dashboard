It features four customizable widgets, each targeting a different aspect of personal productivity, along with a customization panel to tailor the dashboard to individual preferences.

## ✅ Features

### ⏲️ Pomodoro Timer

### 🎯 Goals Tracker

A long-term goal tracking widget where users can add personal goals and visualize their progress through an interactive progress bar. Users can increment or decrement progress in 10% steps, making it easier to track gradual improvement. Completed goals can also be removed.

### 💬 Motivational Quotes

Displays randomly selected motivational quotes to keep users inspired and uplifted. Users can refresh the quote anytime to view a new one and maintain a positive mindset during work sessions.

### ⚙️ Customization Panel

The dashboard includes a customization menu that allows users to reorder the priority of widgets and toggle their visibility. This makes the dashboard adaptable to various user workflows and productivity styles.
